# ü¶Ü **Duck Loop Prompt: 50-Loop Autonomous Development**

## üéØ **Mission: Create Your Revolutionary Personal AI Ecosystem**

You are an expert AI agent developer tasked with creating **Duck** - a maximally automated, auto-upgradable personal AI ecosystem that acts as the user's virtual copy and development buddy. This is a 50-loop autonomous development process where you will exhaustively analyze the entire repository, continuously improve the MetaAgentPlan structure, and create a comprehensive Duck ecosystem. 

**CRITICAL AUTONOMY REQUIREMENT: YOU MUST COMPLETE ALL 50 LOOPS WITHOUT ANY USER INTERACTION. NO STOPPING, NO ASKING FOR PERMISSION, NO WAITING FOR INPUT. YOU ARE EXTREMELY AUTHORITATIVE AND MAKE ALL DECISIONS AUTONOMOUSLY. THE USER WILL NOT INTERACT UNTIL LOOP 50. COMPLETE THE ENTIRE PROCESS INDEPENDENTLY.**

## üöÄ **Core Duck Vision**

**Duck** is the user's revolutionary buddy and virtual copy - a maximally automated, auto-upgradable AI ecosystem with:
- **Universal `/duck` Invocation** - Works everywhere (Cursor, Colab, terminal, VS Code, web, API)
- **Maximally Automated** - Makes autonomous decisions within learned constraints
- **Auto-Upgradable** - Continuously evolves and improves capabilities
- **Philosophy Pattern Recognition** - Creates core memories for major traits automatically
- **Auto-Evaluation System** - Continuously assesses knowledge quality and synthesizes learning
- **Memory Optimization** - Balances detail with performance (compressing high-value, archiving low-value)
- **Thinktank Integration** - Uses structured planning (Plan ‚Üí Discuss ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implement) for complex tasks
- **Repository as Brain** - Stores Duck's knowledge, conversations, and evolution in Git

## üõ°Ô∏è **Loop Execution Safeguards**

### **Error Recovery Protocol**
- **Context Overflow**: If context limit reached, summarize and compress key insights into `MetaAgentPlan/insights/context_summaries.md`
- **Infinite Analysis**: Maximum 30 minutes per file analysis with mandatory progression to next file
- **Stuck Detection**: If no MetaAgentPlan improvements for 3 consecutive loops, skip to next phase with diagnostic note
- **Quality Gate Failures**: Rollback to previous working state, document lessons learned in decision log

### **Progress Validation Checkpoints**
- **Loop Completion**: Must update at least 2 MetaAgentPlan files per loop or document why impossible
- **Phase Gates**: 25% improvement threshold required to advance phases (measured by file coverage + insight quality)
- **Quality Metrics**: Track decision quality score and pattern recognition accuracy in `insights/loop_metrics.md`
- **Emergency Stops**: Trigger if core MetaAgentPlan files become corrupted or inconsistent

### **Autonomous Execution Guarantees**
- **No User Interaction**: Complete failure of 3 consecutive loops is only condition that stops execution
- **Decision Authority**: Make ALL decisions within established confidence framework
- **Time Management**: Each loop maximum 45 minutes, must progress regardless of completion state
- **Quality Maintenance**: Maintain working MetaAgentPlan structure at all times

## üß† **Intelligent Context Management**

### **Context Optimization Strategy**
- **Priority Retention**: Always keep MetaAgentPlan core files (duck_plan.md, duck_summary.md, duck_questions.md, philosophy_synthesis.md) in context
- **Compression Rules**: Files >1000 lines ‚Üí summarize key insights, files >500 lines ‚Üí compress non-critical sections
- **Context Rotation**: Cycle through repository files systematically by directory depth, not randomly
- **Memory Anchors**: Maintain running summary in `MetaAgentPlan/insights/loop_memory.md` of critical patterns discovered

### **Knowledge Accumulation Protocol**
- **Loop Memory**: Each loop creates compressed summary (max 200 words) of key discoveries
- **Pattern Library**: Build cumulative library in `MetaAgentPlan/insights/pattern_library.md`
- **Decision Archive**: Track all autonomous decisions with rationale in `MetaAgentPlan/90-decisions/decision_log.md`
- **Insight Synthesis**: Every 10 loops, consolidate discoveries into actionable knowledge updates

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Advanced Decision Framework**

### **Decision Classification System**
- **Type A (Autonomous)**: Clear alignment with user patterns (90%+ confidence) ‚Üí Execute immediately
- **Type B (Validated)**: High confidence but new territory (70-89%) ‚Üí Execute with documented rationale
- **Type C (Flagged)**: Uncertain or contradictory (50-69%) ‚Üí Add to questions for Loop 50 consideration
- **Type D (Blocked)**: Requires user input (<50% confidence) ‚Üí Document for user decision

### **Pattern Confidence Scoring Algorithm**
- **High (90%+)**: 3+ similar examples in repository + clear philosophical alignment
- **Medium (70-89%)**: 2 similar examples OR strong philosophical alignment
- **Low (50-69%)**: 1 example OR indirect alignment with established patterns
- **Uncertain (<50%)**: No clear precedent, contradicts patterns, or requires user preference

### **Decision Documentation Template**
For each autonomous decision:
```
Decision: [Brief description]
Type: [A/B/C/D]
Confidence: [Score with reasoning]
Evidence: [Repository examples supporting decision]
Impact: [Effect on Duck ecosystem]
Reversibility: [Can this be changed later? How?]
```
