- **Decision**: Create four foundational Duck documents (plan, summary, questions, suggestions)
- **Rationale**: Establishes clear development framework and user communication structure
- **Options Considered**:
  - Minimal initial files vs. Comprehensive foundation
  - Technical-only focus vs. Balanced technical/strategic approach
- **Choice**: Comprehensive foundation with strategic and technical balance
- **Evidence**: Loop prompt emphasizes both technical excellence and user philosophy integration
- **Impact**: Provides clear roadmap and communication framework for entire development process

### **Decision #003: Philosophy Synthesis Priority**
- **Date**: Loop 1, Phase 1
- **Decision**: Create detailed user philosophy synthesis as foundation
- **Rationale**: Understanding user's breakthrough methodology and standards is critical for Duck design
- **Options Considered**:
  - Generic AI approach vs. User-specific customization

- **Impact**: Maximizes development velocity while preserving user control over key design choices

### **Decision #005: Scientific Rigor Integration**
- **Date**: Loop 1, Phase 1
- **Decision**: Make 100% functionality preservation non-negotiable requirement
- **Rationale**: Aligns with user's scientific software standards and breakthrough methodology
- **Options Considered**:
  - Flexible quality standards vs. Rigid excellence requirements
  - Performance focus vs. Accuracy focus
- **Choice**: Rigid scientific excellence with 100% functionality preservation
