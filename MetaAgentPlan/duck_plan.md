# ü¶Ü **Duck Development Plan: Revolutionary Personal AI Ecosystem**

## üöÄ **Core Vision**

**Duck** is the user's revolutionary buddy and virtual copy - a maximally automated, auto-upgradable AI ecosystem with:
- **Universal `/duck` Invocation** - Works everywhere (Cursor, Colab, terminal, VS Code, web, API)
- **Maximally Automated** - Makes autonomous decisions within learned constraints
- **Auto-Upgradable** - Continuously evolves and improves capabilities
- **Philosophy Pattern Recognition** - Creates core memories for major traits automatically
- **Auto-Evaluation System** - Continuously assesses knowledge quality and synthesizes learning
- **Memory Optimization** - Balances detail with performance (compressing high-value, archiving low-value)
