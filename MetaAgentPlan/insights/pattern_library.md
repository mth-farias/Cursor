- **Universal Applicability**: Works from simple to sophisticated modules
- **100% Functionality Preservation**: Identical behavior with enhanced capabilities

### **Pattern Architecture (From Repository Analysis)**

#### **Core Structure**
```python
# CELL 02 — USER INPUT (Authoritative constants)
USER_CONSTANTS = {...}

# CELL 03 — PROCESSING & ASSEMBLY
import _internal_module
_internal_module.configure(USER_CONSTANTS)

# CELL 04 — PUBLIC API
_PUBLIC = {
    "user_inputs": USER_CONSTANTS,
    **_internal_module._PROCESSED_RESULTS,
}
PUBLIC_BUNDLE = MappingProxyType(_PUBLIC)
```

#### **Internal Module Pattern**
```python
# _internal_module/__init__.py
_PROCESSED_RESULTS = None

def configure(user_constants):
    global _PROCESSED_RESULTS
    _PROCESSED_RESULTS = create_processed_bundle(user_constants)
```
