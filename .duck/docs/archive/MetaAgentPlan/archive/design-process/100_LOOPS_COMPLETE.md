## üéØ **5 Critical Questions for Your Decision**

I've identified 5 areas where your input is genuinely important. All have expert recommendations based on comprehensive repository analysis:

### **1. Core Memory Creation Threshold**
**Recommended**: Adaptive (start 95%, lower as Duck learns)  
**Why**: Aligns with your continuous improvement philosophy

### **2. Thinktank vs. Direct Execution**
**Recommended**: Complexity-based (thinktank for complex, direct for simple)  
**Why**: Matches your systematic-yet-efficient approach

### **3. Colab Integration Priority**
**Recommended**: Medium priority (secondary to Cursor mastery)  
**Why**: Leverages proven Cursor success, maintains research capabilities

### **4. Learning Aggressiveness**
**Recommended**: Moderate (balanced learning with validation)  
**Why**: Matches evidence-based approach with practical evolution

### **5. Success Metrics Priority**
**Recommended**: Balanced Scorecard (Technical 40%, User 40%, Learning 20%)  
**Why**: Comprehensive measurement aligns with your approach

**See `LOOP_100_FINAL_PRESENTATION.md` for complete details on each question.**
