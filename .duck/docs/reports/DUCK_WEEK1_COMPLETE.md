## 🚀 How to Use Duck (Right Now!)

### **1. Apply Configuration Pattern**
```bash
python duck_patterns.py config path
```
Get a complete 4-phase implementation plan for `path.py` refactoring.

### **2. Validate a Module**
```bash
# Capture baseline
python duck_validation.py baseline path Codes_Working.Config.path

# Validate refactored
python duck_validation.py validate path Codes.Config.path
```
Ensure 100% functionality preservation.

### **3. Get Power User Guide**
```bash
python duck_patterns.py poweruser
```
Learn 6x efficiency techniques.

### **4. Use Duck in Python**
```python
from duck_system import create_duck

# Initialize Duck
duck = create_duck()

# Make a decision
decision = duck.make_decision(
    title="Apply config pattern to path.py",
    evidence_count=2,
    alignment_strength="strong",
    rationale="Proven pattern with 60-80% reduction"
)

print(f"Confidence: {decision['confidence']:.1f}%")
print(f"Type: {decision['type']}")  # Type A = Autonomous!
```
