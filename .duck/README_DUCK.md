## 💡 How to Use Duck

### **Universal Command (NEW in Phase 2!)** ✨

Duck now has a unified command-line interface:

```bash
# Check Duck's status
duck status

# Apply configuration pattern
duck pattern config path

# List all patterns
duck pattern list

# Validate refactored module
duck validate path

# Organize .cursor/ folder
duck organize cursor --execute

# Analyze repository
duck analyze repo

# Get help
duck help
duck help pattern
```

### **Python API**
```python
from duck_system import create_duck

# Initialize Duck
duck = create_duck()

# Get system information
info = duck.get_system_info()
print(f"Duck version: {info['version']}")
print(f"Patterns loaded: {info['patterns_loaded']}")

# Apply a pattern
result = duck.apply_pattern(
    "Revolutionary Configuration Pattern",
    {"module_path": "path.py"}
)
print(result["strategy"])

# Make an autonomous decision
decision = duck.make_decision(
    title="Apply configuration pattern to path.py",
    evidence_count=2,  # Based on experiment.py, color.py
    alignment_strength="strong",
    rationale="Proven pattern with 60-80% code reduction"
)
print(f"Decision type: {decision['type']}")
print(f"Confidence: {decision['confidence']:.1f}%")

# Get system statistics
stats = duck.get_stats()
print(stats)
```

### **Pattern Recognition**
```python
# Get high-confidence patterns (90%+)
high_conf_patterns = duck.pattern_engine.get_high_confidence_patterns()

# Get patterns by category
workflow_patterns = duck.pattern_engine.get_patterns_by_category("workflow")
quality_patterns = duck.pattern_engine.get_patterns_by_category("quality")

# Get specific pattern
config_pattern = duck.pattern_engine.get_pattern(
    "Revolutionary Configuration Pattern"
)
print(config_pattern["application_strategy"])
```

### **Memory Management**
```python
# Get user philosophy
philosophy = duck.memory_system.get_user_philosophy()
methodology = duck.memory_system.get_user_philosophy("methodology")

# Check if should create core memory
should_create = duck.memory_system.should_create_core_memory(
    confidence=95.0
)

# Adjust memory threshold (as Duck learns)
duck.memory_system.adjust_threshold(0.90)  # Lower to 90%
```
