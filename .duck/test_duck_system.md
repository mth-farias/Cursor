## 🎯 Duck Capabilities (Currently Implemented)

### **Pattern Application**
```python
duck = create_duck()
result = duck.apply_pattern("Revolutionary Configuration Pattern", context)
# Returns: implementation guidance with 4-phase process
```

### **Autonomous Decision-Making**
```python
decision = duck.make_decision(
    title="Apply configuration pattern to path.py",
    evidence_count=2,  # experiment.py, color.py
    alignment_strength="strong",
    rationale="Proven pattern with 60-80% reduction"
)
# Returns: DecisionSchema with confidence and classification
```

### **Pattern Recognition**
```python
# Get high-confidence patterns
patterns = duck.pattern_engine.get_high_confidence_patterns(threshold=90.0)
# Returns: All patterns with 90%+ confidence

# Get patterns by category
workflow_patterns = duck.pattern_engine.get_patterns_by_category("workflow")
# Returns: All workflow patterns
```

### **Memory Management**
```python
# Check if should create core memory
should_create = duck.memory_system.should_create_core_memory(confidence=95.0)
# Returns: True (above initial threshold)

# Get user philosophy
methodology = duck.memory_system.get_user_philosophy("methodology")
# Returns: All methodology preferences
```

### **System Statistics**
```python
stats = duck.get_stats()
# Returns comprehensive system statistics
```
