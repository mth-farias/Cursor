# 🧠 **Thinktank Workflow: Plan → Discuss → Design → Implement**

## 🎯 **Workflow Overview**
The thinktank methodology ensures thorough planning and decision capture before implementation, following scientific rigor principles.

## 📋 **Standard Thinktank Structure**
```
thinktank/[project-name]/
├── README.md              # Project overview & context
├── ANALYSIS.md            # Current state analysis
├── PLAN.md               # Step-by-step implementation plan
├── DECISIONS.md          # All decisions made during discussion
├── ARCHITECTURE.md       # Technical design & structure
├── IMPLEMENTATION.md     # Detailed implementation steps
└── REFERENCES.md         # Links to all relevant files
```

## 🚀 **Workflow Steps**

### **Step 1: Plan (Project Setup)**
1. **Create thinktank directory** for the project
2. **Create README.md** with project overview
3. **Create ANALYSIS.md** for current state assessment
4. **Define success criteria** and requirements

### **Step 2: Discuss (Decision Capture)**
1. **Capture all decisions** in DECISIONS.md
2. **Document rationale** for each decision
3. **List alternatives considered** and why rejected
4. **Track impact** of each decision

### **Step 3: Design (Architecture)**
1. **Create ARCHITECTURE.md** with technical design
2. **Document file structure** and relationships
3. **Define interfaces** and dependencies
4. **Plan implementation phases**

### **Step 4: Implement (Execution)**
1. **Create IMPLEMENTATION.md** with detailed steps
2. **Execute step-by-step** following the plan
3. **Validate each step** before proceeding
4. **Document lessons learned**

## 📊 **Decision Capture Format**
```markdown
## **Decision #[NUMBER]: [DECISION_TITLE]**
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Status**: ✅ **APPROVED** | 🚧 **PENDING** | ❌ **REJECTED**

### **Decision**
[What was decided]

### **Rationale**
[Why this decision was made]

### **Alternatives Considered**
- **Option A**: [Alternative 1] - [Why rejected]
- **Option B**: [Alternative 2] - [Why rejected]

### **Impact**
- **Positive**: [Benefits]
- **Negative**: [Drawbacks]
- **Mitigation**: [How to address drawbacks]
```

## 🎯 **Quality Standards**
- **Evidence-based decisions** - All choices backed by rationale
- **Complete documentation** - Capture all reasoning and alternatives
- **Impact assessment** - Understand consequences of decisions
- **Scientific rigor** - Follow reproducible methodology

## 🚀 **Best Practices**
- **Start with thinktank** for any complex project
- **Capture decisions immediately** - Don't rely on memory
- **Document rationale** - Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- **Review decisions** - Validate choices before implementation
- **Learn from experience** - Improve methodology over time

**This workflow ensures thorough planning and decision capture for all complex projects.**
