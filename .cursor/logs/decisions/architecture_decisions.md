## ADR-001: Configuration-Based Architecture Pattern
**Date**: 2024-10-02  
**Status**: ✅ ADOPTED (experiment.py success)

### Context
Need to refactor Config modules from cell-based monolithic files to modern Python while preserving 100% functionality.

### Decision
Adopt configuration-based architecture pattern:
1. User constants stay in main module
2. Processing logic moves to `_module/` package
3. Single `configure()` function handles all complexity
4. Clean separation: user interface vs implementation

### Rationale
- **Ultra-clean main files**: Reduces experiment.py from 570 to 230 lines
- **Perfect separation**: Users only see/edit constants, complexity hidden
- **Maintained interfaces**: All existing imports continue to work
- **Revolutionary simplicity**: Single configure() call replaces complex processing

### Consequences
- ✅ **Positive**: Dramatic simplification, better maintainability
- ✅ **Positive**: Easy to apply pattern to remaining modules
- ⚠️ **Trade-off**: Slightly more complex internal structure (acceptable)

### Evidence
- experiment.py refactoring: 100% functionality preserved
- Validation: All constants, functions, outputs identical
- Usability: Much easier to understand and modify

## ADR-002: .cursor Folder Organization
**Date**: 2024-10-02  
**Status**: ✅ ADOPTED

### Context
Original `.cursor/docs/` nested structure was complex and hard to navigate.

### Decision
Flat, purpose-specific organization:
- `rules/` - Cursor AI rules (.mdc files)
- `guides/` - Comprehensive documentation
- `examples/` - Code templates & patterns  
- `templates/` - Reusable templates
- `logs/` - Change tracking & history
- `plans/` - Future work planning
- `prompts/` - AI interaction templates
- `validation/` - Testing & validation

### Rationale
- **Clear navigation**: Each folder has obvious purpose
- **Better usability**: No more nested `docs/guides/examples/prompts/`
- **Enhanced workflow**: Templates and tracking support development
- **Maintainability**: Organized by function, not arbitrary nesting

### Consequences
- ✅ **Positive**: Much easier to find and organize files
- ✅ **Positive**: Better workflow support with templates and tracking
- ✅ **Positive**: Scalable structure for future growth

## ADR-003: MappingProxyType for Immutable APIs
**Date**: 2024-10-02 (Reaffirmed)  
**Status**: ✅ ADOPTED (Continued)

### Context
Need immutable public APIs for scientific reproducibility and safety.

### Decision
Continue using `MappingProxyType` for all Config module exports.

### Rationale
- **Scientific safety**: Prevents accidental modification
- **Thread safety**: Safe to share across modules
- **Clear interfaces**: Obvious what's public vs internal
- **Proven pattern**: Works excellently in experiment.py

### Consequences
- ✅ **Positive**: Robust, safe APIs
- ✅ **Positive**: Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ **Positive**: Scientific reproducibility guaranteed

## ADR-004: Cell-Based Structure Preservation
**Date**: 2024-10-02 (Reaffirmed)  
**Status**: ✅ ADOPTED (Transitional)

### Context
Current codebase uses cell-based organization (`#%% CELL XX`).

### Decision
Preserve cell structure during transition to standard Python modules.

### Rationale
- **Familiarity**: Maintains current development patterns
- **Clear organization**: Cells provide logical structure
- **Gradual transition**: Easier to migrate incrementally
- **Documentation**: Cells serve as internal documentation

### Consequences
- ✅ **Positive**: Smooth transition, no disruption
- ✅ **Positive**: Clear internal organization
- ⚠️ **Trade-off**: Eventually will transition to standard modules

## ADR-005: 100% Functionality Preservation Requirement
**Date**: 2024-10-02 (Reaffirmed)  
**Status**: ✅ ADOPTED (Mandatory)

### Context
Refactoring scientific software requires absolute reliability.

### Decision
Mandate 100% functionality preservation for all refactoring:
- All constants must have identical values
- All functions must produce identical outputs
- All imports must work unchanged
- All behavior must be preserved exactly

### Rationale
- **Scientific integrity**: Research depends on consistent results
- **Risk mitigation**: Prevents introduction of subtle bugs
- **Confidence**: Enables aggressive refactoring with safety
- **Validation**: Comprehensive testing ensures reliability

### Consequences
- ✅ **Positive**: Complete confidence in refactored code
- ✅ **Positive**: Enables bold architectural improvements
- ⚠️ **Trade-off**: Requires comprehensive validation (acceptable cost)

## ADR-006: Revolutionary Configuration Pattern
**Date**: 2024-10-02  
**Status**: ✅ ADOPTED (experiment.py proven)

### Context
Need clean separation between user constants and processing logic while maintaining ultra-simple user interface.

### Decision
Adopt configure() function pattern for all Config modules:
- User constants remain in main file
- Single configure() call orchestrates all processing
- Internal modules handle complexity
- Clean public API assembly from configured bundles

### Evidence
- experiment.py: 570 → 230 lines (60% reduction)
- 100% functionality preservation validated
- Dramatically improved maintainability
- Clean, testable architecture
- Easy to extend and modify

### Rationale
- **Revolutionary simplicity**: Single function call handles all complexity
- **Clean separation**: User interface completely separated from implementation
- **Dependency orchestration**: configure() handles complex inter-module dependencies
- **Immutable results**: All bundles use MappingProxyType for safety
- **Scientific rigor**: 100% functionality preservation with comprehensive validation
- **Proven success**: Demonstrated breakthrough results in experiment.py

### Implementation Pattern
```python
# Main file: User constants + single configure() call
USER_CONSTANTS = {...}
_module.configure(USER_CONSTANTS)
PUBLIC_API = MappingProxyType({**USER_CONSTANTS, **_module._BUNDLES})

# _module/__init__.py: Configuration orchestration
def configure(user_params):
    global _BUNDLE1, _BUNDLE2
    _BUNDLE1 = component1.create_bundle(user_params)
    _BUNDLE2 = component2.create_bundle(user_params, _BUNDLE1)
```

### Consequences
- ✅ **Positive**: Revolutionary improvement in code clarity and maintainability
- ✅ **Positive**: Pattern proven and ready for replication
- ✅ **Positive**: Establishes new standard for Config module architecture

### Next Applications
Apply to color.py, param.py, path.py using proven playbook

## Future Decisions Needed
- **Color.py architecture**: Apply configuration pattern (recommended based on experiment.py success)
- **Param.py complexity**: How to handle extensive validation logic within configuration pattern?
- **Path.py file system**: Special considerations for filesystem operations within pattern?
- **BehaviorClassifier**: Extension of patterns to main classification engine?
