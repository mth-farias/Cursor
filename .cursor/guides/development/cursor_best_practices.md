# Cursor Best Practices for Scientific Computing

## 🎯 **Comprehensive Guide to Cursor Mastery**

This guide compiles all the best practices, techniques, and strategies discovered through the experiment.py breakthrough and optimized for scientific software development.

## 🚀 **Core Principles**

### **1. Context is King**
- **Load comprehensive context** before starting any work
- **Use strategic file references** (@file.py) for targeted context loading
- **Layer context appropriately** (foundation → strategy → implementation → validation)
- **Refresh context regularly** to maintain relevance and accuracy

### **2. Parallel Processing Power**
- **Use parallel tool calls** whenever possible for maximum efficiency
- **Batch related operations** (multiple file reads, searches, analyses)
- **Plan comprehensive investigations** upfront to execute all searches together
- **Avoid sequential operations** unless output of one is required for input of next

### **3. Scientific Rigor First**
- **100% functionality preservation** is non-negotiable for scientific software
- **Validate incrementally** throughout development, not just at the end
- **Preserve exact numerical precision** and calculation order
- **Maintain all error conditions** and validation constraints

### **4. Pattern-Based Development**
- **Apply proven patterns** from successful refactoring (experiment.py)
- **Document breakthrough innovations** for replication
- **Evolve patterns through iteration** rather than forcing initial designs
- **Create reusable templates** for common operations

## 🔧 **Advanced Techniques**

### **Context Management Mastery**

#### **Strategic Context Loading**
```
# Foundation Layer (always load first):
@.cursor/guides/project/context.md           # Project understanding
@.cursor/logs/active/current_focus.md        # Current work status
@.cursor/plans/next_targets.md               # Immediate priorities

# Strategy Layer (for planning/implementation):
@.cursor/guides/refactoring/playbook.md      # Proven strategies
@.cursor/examples/breakthrough_pattern.py    # Success patterns
@.cursor/logs/decisions/architecture_decisions.md # Key decisions

# Implementation Layer (for active work):
@current_work_files                          # Files being modified
@.cursor/templates/validation_template.py    # Testing framework
@.cursor/rules/scientific.mdc                # Quality standards

# Validation Layer (for testing):
@original_system_files                       # Reference implementation
@refactored_system_files                     # New implementation
@.cursor/prompts/before_commit_validation.md # Validation checklist
```

#### **Context Refresh Strategy**
```
# When to refresh (every 2-3 hours or when):
- Context feels stale or irrelevant
- Switching between different types of work
- After major architectural decisions
- When responses become less accurate

# How to refresh:
1. Save current work state
2. Update .cursor/logs/active/current_focus.md
3. Clear context and reload essentials
4. Load updated project state files
5. Continue with fresh, relevant context
```

### **Parallel Tool Call Optimization**

#### **Analysis Phase Parallelization**
```
# Instead of sequential:
read_file: module.py (lines 1-100) → wait
read_file: module.py (lines 100-200) → wait
codebase_search: "functionality" → wait

# Use parallel:
read_file: module.py (lines 1-100)
read_file: module.py (lines 100-200)
read_file: module.py (lines 200-300)
codebase_search: "how does module work?"
codebase_search: "what are dependencies?"
grep: "key_constants|important_functions"
[All results arrive together - 6x faster]
```

#### **Comprehensive Investigation Pattern**
```
# For understanding new modules:
Parallel execution:
1. read_file: complete module structure
2. codebase_search: "how does [module] work?"
3. codebase_search: "what depends on [module]?"
4. grep: key constants and function names
5. read_file: related modules and dependencies
6. codebase_search: "what are the main components?"

Result: Complete understanding in single response cycle
```

### **Validation Integration**

#### **Incremental Validation Pattern**
```
# After each major change:
1. Create/update validation script for component
2. Test specific functionality that changed
3. Compare outputs with original system
4. Document validation results
5. Proceed only if 100% match achieved

# Benefits:
- Catch issues early before they compound
- Maintain confidence throughout refactoring
- Enable aggressive architectural improvements
- Reduce debugging time significantly
```

#### **Comprehensive Pre-Commit Validation**
```
# Before any commit:
@.cursor/prompts/before_commit_validation.md
@original_system/ @refactored_system/
@.cursor/templates/validation_template.py

# Systematic validation:
1. Load both systems dynamically
2. Compare all public API elements
3. Test all functions with identical inputs
4. Verify all constants have identical values
5. Test edge cases and error conditions
6. Validate performance characteristics
7. Document validation results
```

## 📊 **Workflow Optimization**

### **Session Management Excellence**

#### **Session Startup Optimization**
```
# Quick Start (2 minutes):
@.cursor/prompts/starter.md                  # Full project context
@.cursor/logs/active/current_focus.md        # Current status
@target_work_files                           # Specific work focus

# Deep Start (5 minutes):
@.cursor/prompts/starter.md                  # Full project context
@.cursor/guides/refactoring/playbook.md      # Strategy reference
@.cursor/examples/breakthrough_pattern.py    # Success patterns
@original_system_files                       # Reference implementation
@.cursor/rules/ (all files)                  # Complete standards
```

#### **Session Handoff Excellence**
```
# Before ending session (5 minutes):
1. Update .cursor/logs/active/current_focus.md:
   - Move completed items to "Recently Completed"
   - Update "Currently Working On" with exact status
   - Add insights, blockers, or decisions to "Notes"

2. Commit work with descriptive message
3. Update .cursor/plans/next_targets.md if priorities changed
4. Document architectural insights in decisions log
5. Update any relevant templates or examples

# Benefits:
- Seamless session transitions
- No loss of context or progress
- Clear handoff for future work
- Continuous improvement of .cursor setup
```

### **Decision Making Framework**

#### **Evidence-Based Architecture Decisions**
```
# For major architectural choices:
1. Load successful patterns and examples
2. Analyze current module characteristics
3. Consider scientific requirements and constraints
4. Test proposed approach with small prototype
5. Document decision rationale in architecture log
6. Make decision based on evidence, not intuition

# Decision criteria:
- Does it preserve functionality? (mandatory)
- Does it follow proven patterns? (preferred)
- Does it improve maintainability? (desired)
- Is it scientifically sound? (mandatory)
- Can it be validated easily? (important)
```

#### **Quick Decision Framework**
```
# For implementation details:
1. Functionality preservation check (pass/fail)
2. Pattern alignment check (good/acceptable/poor)
3. Maintainability impact (positive/neutral/negative)
4. Scientific soundness check (pass/fail)
5. Validation feasibility (easy/moderate/difficult)

# Decision matrix:
- All mandatory criteria must pass
- Prefer solutions with good pattern alignment
- Choose positive maintainability impact when possible
- Favor easy validation when functionality is equivalent
```

## 🎯 **Scientific Computing Specialization**

### **Numerical Precision Preservation**
```
# Critical practices:
1. Identify all numerical constants and calculations
2. Preserve exact precision (no float rounding)
3. Maintain identical calculation order
4. Test with edge cases and boundary values
5. Validate outputs to machine precision
6. Document any precision-critical operations

# Validation approach:
- Use np.allclose() with very tight tolerances (1e-15)
- Test with extreme values (very large, very small)
- Verify identical behavior at numerical boundaries
- Test with NaN and infinity values
```

### **Error Handling Preservation**
```
# Scientific error handling requirements:
1. Preserve all error messages exactly
2. Maintain error condition logic identically
3. Keep validation constraints unchanged
4. Test error paths thoroughly
5. Document error handling changes (if any)

# Testing strategy:
- Test with invalid inputs
- Test boundary conditions
- Test with missing data
- Test with corrupted data
- Verify error message formatting
```

### **Performance Considerations**
```
# Scientific computing performance:
1. Profile critical paths before refactoring
2. Maintain or improve performance
3. Avoid introducing unnecessary overhead
4. Optimize import patterns for large modules
5. Use lazy evaluation where appropriate

# Benchmarking approach:
- Time critical operations before and after
- Test with realistic data sizes
- Monitor memory usage patterns
- Validate performance with edge cases
```

## 🚀 **Advanced Cursor Features**

### **Semantic Search Mastery**
```
# Effective scientific search patterns:
"How does [module] handle [specific_functionality]?"
"What are the dependencies between [component1] and [component2]?"
"Where is [scientific_concept] implemented in the codebase?"
"How is [validation_constraint] enforced throughout the system?"

# Multi-query strategy for comprehensive understanding:
Query 1: "How does the module work overall?"
Query 2: "What are the main components and their relationships?"
Query 3: "Where are the critical validation points?"
Query 4: "How is scientific accuracy maintained?"
```

### **File Reference Optimization**
```
# Strategic @file references:
@original_system/           # Complete reference system
@working_system/            # Enhanced reference system
@target_system/             # Current refactoring target
@.cursor/rules/             # All coding standards
@.cursor/examples/          # All proven patterns
@.cursor/guides/refactoring/ # All strategy documentation

# Focused @file references:
@specific_module.py         # Target file for focused work
@.cursor/examples/pattern.py # Specific pattern reference
@.cursor/templates/validation.py # Specific template
```

### **Composer Mode Excellence**
```
# Multi-file editing strategy:
1. Open main module file (user interface)
2. Open internal modules (implementation)
3. Open validation script (testing)
4. Open change log (documentation)
5. Edit all files coherently with Cursor's help

# Benefits:
- Maintain consistency across related files
- See immediate impact of changes
- Coordinate complex refactoring operations
- Ensure comprehensive documentation
```
