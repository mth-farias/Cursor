# Fly Behavior Pipeline - Project Context

## Project Team Declaration

### Our Mission
We are a **scientific software development team** dedicated to creating professional, open-source tools for behavioral neuroscience research. Our current mission is to **refactor and modernize** an existing fly behavior classification pipeline to meet publication standards and prepare it for open-source release.

### Current Status
- **Working Pipeline**: We have a functional system that successfully classifies fly behaviors
- **Code Quality**: The current code works but needs modernization for professional standards
- **Publication Goal**: We aim to publish this as a peer-reviewed scientific software package
- **Open Source Vision**: Make the tools freely available to the scientific community

### Our Refactoring Approach

#### Why We're Refactoring
1. **Publication Standards**: Scientific software must meet high quality standards for peer review
2. **Maintainability**: Current cell-based structure is difficult to maintain and extend
3. **Collaboration**: Standard Python modules enable better team development
4. **Performance**: Modern architecture will handle larger datasets efficiently
5. **Accessibility**: Better structure makes the code easier for others to use and contribute

#### How We're Using Cursor
**Cursor is our AI coding coach** that helps us:
- **Learn best practices** for modern Python development
- **Maintain consistency** across all code modules
- **Catch potential issues** before they become problems
- **Follow scientific computing standards** for reproducible research
- **Create professional documentation** and type hints
- **Implement proper testing** and quality assurance

#### Our Development Philosophy
- **Quality over speed**: We take time to do things right
- **Learning together**: Cursor teaches us modern practices as we code
- **Scientific rigor**: Every decision supports reproducible research
- **Community focus**: We build for the broader scientific community
- **Iterative improvement**: We refactor one module at a time, learning as we go
- **File-focused work**: Only work on the specific file being discussed, no unsolicited file creation
- **Flexible rules**: We can override any rule when scientifically justified, but always flag it clearly
- **Evidence-based decisions**: Every architectural choice is backed by scientific rationale

#### Team Structure
- **Lead Developer**: Matheus (project owner, scientific domain expert)
- **AI Coach**: Cursor (coding standards, best practices, quality assurance)
- **Future Contributors**: Open source community (after publication)

## What We're Building

This project is a **scientific software pipeline** for automatically classifying defensive behaviors in fruit flies (Drosophila). Think of it as a "smart microscope" that can watch a fly and tell you exactly what it's doing - whether it's walking, freezing, jumping, or showing other defensive responses.

## Why This Matters

### The Scientific Problem
Scientists studying animal behavior need to analyze thousands of hours of video footage to understand how animals respond to threats. Currently, this requires:
- **Manual observation** by trained researchers (extremely time-consuming)
- **Inconsistent results** between different observers
- **Limited scalability** for large datasets
- **High costs** for human labor

### Our Solution
We're building an **automated system** that can:
- **Watch videos** of fruit flies in experimental arenas
- **Track their movements** using computer vision
- **Classify behaviors** automatically (Walk, Stationary, Freeze, Jump, Resistant_Freeze)
- **Generate reports** with statistical analysis
- **Scale to thousands** of experiments

## How It Works

### The Complete Pipeline

```
1. EXPERIMENT SETUP
   User opens Google Colab â†’ Inputs experimental parameters â†’ System downloads code

2. DATA COLLECTION  
   Raw video (BASE.avi) + tracking data (BASE.csv) â†’ External software processes

3. BEHAVIOR CLASSIFICATION
   Our pipeline analyzes the data â†’ Produces behavior classifications

4. RESULTS & ANALYSIS
   Scored behaviors + statistical analysis â†’ Scientific insights
```

### Technical Architecture

**Current System (Working but needs improvement):**
```
RawData/ (BASE.avi, BASE.csv) 
    â†“ (external tracking software)
PostProcessing/ (Tracked/, Sleap/, ArenaImage/, FlyVideo/, CropVideo/)
    â†“ (our classification pipeline)
BehaviorClassification/ (Scored/, Pose/, Error/, Flag/)
```

**New Proposed System (Better organized):**
```
PostProcessing/
â”œâ”€â”€ fly1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ arenaimg.png          # Image of the experimental arena
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ flyvideo.avi          # Video of just this fly
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cropvideo.avi         # Cropped video for analysis
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tracked/              # Movement tracking data
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ centroidX.csv     # X coordinates over time
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ centroidY.csv     # Y coordinates over time
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ speed.csv         # Speed measurements
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ scored/               # Behavior classifications
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ behavior.csv      # What the fly was doing
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ confidence.csv    # How certain we are
â”œâ”€â”€ fly2/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ... (same structure)
```

### Data Structure Benefits
- **Per-fly organization**: All data for one fly in one folder
- **Single parameter files**: One CSV per parameter (centroidX, speed, etc.)
- **Scalable**: Easy to handle 1000+ flies
- **Efficient**: Only load the parameters you need
- **Scientific**: Matches how biologists think about individual animals

## The Scientific Context

### What We're Studying
- **Defensive behaviors** in fruit flies when they encounter threats
- **How flies respond** to visual stimuli (like looming objects)
- **Individual differences** in defensive strategies
- **Neural mechanisms** underlying these behaviors

### Why Fruit Flies?
- **Model organism** for neuroscience research
- **Simple nervous system** that's easier to understand
- **Genetic tools** available for manipulation
- **Fast reproduction** for large-scale studies

### The Behaviors We Classify
1. **Walk** - Normal movement around the arena
2. **Stationary** - Sitting still, not moving
3. **Freeze** - Sudden stop in response to threat
4. **Jump** - Quick escape movement
5. **Resistant_Freeze** - Prolonged defensive posture

## Technical Challenges We're Solving

### 1. Data Organization
**Problem**: Current system organizes files by type (all tracked files together, all scored files together)
**Solution**: New system organizes by individual fly, making it easier to analyze each animal's complete behavior

### 2. Code Structure
**Problem**: Current code uses "cells" (like Jupyter notebooks) which is hard to maintain
**Solution**: Convert to standard Python modules that are easier to understand and modify

### 3. Scalability
**Problem**: Current system struggles with large datasets (1000+ flies)
**Solution**: Optimize for performance and create efficient data structures

### 4. User Experience
**Problem**: Current system requires technical knowledge to use
**Solution**: Create simple Google Colab interface that anyone can use
