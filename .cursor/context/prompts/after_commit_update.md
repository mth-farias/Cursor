- Document any pattern refinements or architectural insights

### 4. Completed Work Documentation
**Files**: `@.cursor/logs/completed/`

- **Update existing logs**: If this extends previous work

### 5. Project Documentation
**Files**: `@.cursor/guides/project/`
- **`context.md`**: Update "Current Status" and "Progress Status" if major milestone

- **`scientific_context.md`**: Update if biological/research aspects changed

### 6. Refactoring Documentation
**Files**: `@.cursor/guides/refactoring/`
- **`general_strategy.md`**: Update if refactoring approach evolved
- **`configuration_pattern_playbook.md`**: Update if pattern was refined or adapted
- **`validation_strategy.md`**: Update if validation approach changed

### 7. Development Resources
**Files**: `@.cursor/guides/development/`
- **Update workflow guides** if new techniques were discovered
- **Update best practices** if new patterns emerged
- **Update troubleshooting** if new solutions were found

### 8. Examples & Templates
**Files**: `@.cursor/examples/` and `@.cursor/templates/`
- **Add new examples** if breakthrough patterns were established
- **Update existing examples** if patterns were refined
- **Update templates** if process improvements were made

### 9. Validation & Testing
**Files**: `@.cursor/validation/`
- **Update validation scripts** if new testing approaches were developed
- **Add new validation reports** if comprehensive testing was completed
- **Update baselines** if reference data changed

## Strategic Questions
1. **What should be the next immediate priority** based on what I just completed?
2. **Are there any dependencies** I should consider for the next work?
3. **What patterns or lessons learned** should be captured for future use?
4. **Should any examples or templates be updated** based on this work?
5. **Are there any architectural insights** that should be documented?
6. **Should any guides or best practices be updated** based on new discoveries?
