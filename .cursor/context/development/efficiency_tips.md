# Cursor Efficiency Tips for Scientific Computing

## ⚡ **Maximum Productivity Techniques**

This guide provides specific, actionable tips to dramatically increase your efficiency when using Cursor for scientific software development, based on breakthrough results from the experiment.py refactoring.

## 🚀 **Speed Optimization Techniques**

### **1. Context Loading Speed Hacks**

#### **The 5-Second Context Load**
```
# Instead of loading files one by one (30+ seconds):
@file1.py → wait → @file2.py → wait → @file3.py

# Load everything in parallel (5 seconds):
@file1.py @file2.py @file3.py @file4.py @file5.py @file6.py
```

#### **Strategic Context Layering**
```
# Layer 1 - Foundation (always load first):
@.cursor/logs/active/current_focus.md @.cursor/plans/next_targets.md

# Layer 2 - Strategy (add when planning):
+ @.cursor/guides/refactoring/playbook.md @.cursor/examples/pattern.py

# Layer 3 - Implementation (add when coding):
+ @current_work_files @.cursor/templates/validation.py

# Layer 4 - Validation (add when testing):
+ @original_system/ @refactored_system/
```

#### **Context Refresh Triggers**
```
# Refresh context when:
- Responses become less accurate (every 2-3 hours)
- Switching work types (planning → coding → validation)
- After major architectural decisions
- When context feels stale or irrelevant

# Quick refresh (30 seconds):
1. Save current state
2. Clear context
3. Load foundation + current work
4. Continue with fresh context
```

### **2. Parallel Processing Mastery**

#### **The 6x Analysis Speed Boost**
```
# Sequential analysis (slow):
read_file: module.py (part 1) → wait
read_file: module.py (part 2) → wait
codebase_search: "functionality" → wait
grep: "constants" → wait

# Parallel analysis (6x faster):
read_file: module.py (part 1)
read_file: module.py (part 2)
read_file: module.py (part 3)
codebase_search: "how does module work?"
codebase_search: "what are dependencies?"
grep: "CONSTANTS|FUNCTIONS"
[All results arrive together]
```

#### **Comprehensive Investigation Pattern**
```
# For new module understanding:
Parallel execution:
1. read_file: complete module (multiple parts if large)
2. codebase_search: "how does [module] work overall?"
3. codebase_search: "what are the main components?"
4. codebase_search: "what depends on [module]?"
5. grep: key constants and function names
6. read_file: related modules and dependencies

Result: Complete understanding in single response
```

### **3. Session Management Efficiency**

#### **2-Minute Session Startup**
```
# Quick start template:
@.cursor/prompts/starter.md                  # Full project context
@.cursor/logs/active/current_focus.md        # Current status
@target_work_file.py                         # Specific focus

# Result: Immediately productive, no warmup time
```

#### **5-Minute Session Handoff**
```
# Before ending session:
1. Update current_focus.md (2 minutes)
2. Commit with descriptive message (1 minute)
3. Update next_targets.md if needed (1 minute)
4. Document insights in decisions log (1 minute)

# Result: Perfect session transitions, no lost context
```

## 🔧 **Workflow Optimization Hacks**

### **1. Template-Based Speed**

#### **Instant Context Loading**
```
# Create custom templates for common scenarios:

# Template: New Module Refactoring
@.cursor/guides/project/context.md
@.cursor/guides/refactoring/playbook.md
@.cursor/examples/breakthrough_pattern.py
@original_module.py
@.cursor/rules/scientific.mdc

# Template: Validation Work
@.cursor/prompts/before_commit_validation.md
@original_system/ @refactored_system/
@.cursor/templates/validation_template.py

# Template: Troubleshooting
@.cursor/guides/development/troubleshooting_playbook.md
@problematic_code.py
@.cursor/examples/working_patterns.py
```

#### **Smart Template Selection**
```
# Choose template based on work type:
- New refactoring → "New Module Refactoring" template
- Continuing work → "Quick Start" template
- Before commit → "Validation Work" template
- Having issues → "Troubleshooting" template
- Learning → "Pattern Study" template
```

### **2. Decision Making Speed**

#### **5-Second Decision Framework**
```
# For implementation decisions:
1. Functionality preserved? (pass/fail) - 1 second
2. Follows proven pattern? (yes/no) - 1 second
3. Improves maintainability? (yes/no) - 1 second
4. Scientifically sound? (pass/fail) - 1 second
5. Easy to validate? (yes/no) - 1 second

# Decision: Go with option that passes all mandatory checks
```

#### **Evidence-Based Quick Decisions**
```
# For architectural choices:
1. Load successful pattern example - 5 seconds
2. Check if pattern applies to current situation - 10 seconds
3. Adapt pattern to specific needs - 30 seconds
4. Implement with confidence - immediate

# Result: Fast, evidence-based decisions
```

### **3. Validation Speed Hacks**

#### **Incremental Validation (80% Time Savings)**
```
# Instead of end-of-work validation (hours):
- Implement entire refactoring
- Run comprehensive validation
- Fix all issues found
- Re-validate everything

# Use incremental validation (minutes):
- Implement one component
- Validate that component immediately
- Fix issues before they compound
- Move to next component with confidence
```

#### **Parallel Validation Testing**
```
# Test multiple aspects simultaneously:
validate_constants()      # Test all constants match
validate_functions()      # Test all functions work
validate_integration()    # Test module integration
validate_performance()    # Test performance maintained
[All tests run in parallel - 4x faster]
```

## 📊 **Productivity Multipliers**

### **1. Pattern Recognition Speed**

#### **Instant Pattern Application**
```
# Build pattern library for instant access:
@.cursor/examples/experiment_breakthrough_pattern.py  # Proven success
@.cursor/examples/configuration_pattern.py           # General template
@.cursor/examples/validation_pattern.py              # Testing template

# Result: Apply proven patterns instantly, no reinvention
```

#### **Pattern Adaptation Speed**
```
# Quick adaptation process:
1. Load proven pattern - 5 seconds
2. Identify module-specific needs - 30 seconds
3. Adapt pattern to needs - 2 minutes
4. Implement adapted pattern - 10 minutes

# Result: Custom solutions in minutes, not hours
```

### **2. Knowledge Reuse Efficiency**

#### **Instant Access to Solutions**
```
# Build solution library:
@.cursor/guides/development/troubleshooting_playbook.md  # Common issues
@.cursor/logs/decisions/architecture_decisions.md       # Past decisions
@.cursor/logs/completed/                                # Success stories

# Result: Solve problems instantly using past solutions
```

#### **Learning Acceleration**
```
# Accelerated learning pattern:

2. Search solution library for similar cases
3. Adapt existing solution to new context
4. Document new solution for future use

# Result: Exponential learning curve, not linear
```

### **3. Communication Efficiency**

#### **Precise Context Communication**
```
# Instead of vague descriptions:
"I'm having issues with the refactoring"

# Use precise context:
"I'm refactoring color.py using the configuration pattern from experiment.py, 
but the matplotlib colormap generation in _color/colormaps.py is producing 
different results than the original system. Here's the specific validation failure..."

# Result: Cursor understands exactly what you need
```

#### **Efficient Problem Description**
```
# Problem description template:
1. What I'm trying to do: [specific goal]
2. What I expected: [expected result]
3. What actually happened: [actual result]
4. Context files: @relevant_files
5. Error details: [specific error messages]

# Result: Faster problem resolution
```

## ⚡ **Speed Hacks by Work Type**
